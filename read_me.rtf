Here you can find my assignment\
\
The app is simple, it consists of two pages:\
Dashboard - a simple dashboard that shows you current data of the drone\
	Data receiving is through API\
 \
Analysis - a page that shows data took from drone:\
		
\f1\fs26 Average Reference Signal Received Power of LTE in dBm\
		Graph showing Reference Signal Received Power of LTE during time\
		Average Altitude of the Drone\

\cf0 In Future I\'92d like to realise more detailed analysis in my app + add auhtentificaion and registration using API and JWT tokens.\
\
Also I didn\'92t have a time to create a proper front-end so don\'92t judge strict. }
