Hi,

Here you can find my assignment.

The app is simple, it consists of two pages:
Dashboard - a simple dashboard that shows you current data of the drone.
Analysis - a page that shows data took from drone:
  analyzing link reliability, latency, and LTE cell switching.
  Graph showing Reference Signal Received Power of LTE during time
  Graph showing Average Altitude of the Drone during time
	Graph showing Distribution of Status Arrival Frequency Interval
	Graph showing Distribution of Telemetry Arrival Frequency Intervals

 In Future I\'92d like to realise more detailed analysis in my app + add auhtentificaion and registration
